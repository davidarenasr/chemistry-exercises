#To determine the density of a rectangular metal bar, a student made the following measurements: 
# length, 8.53 cm; width, 2.4 cm; height, 1.0 cm; mass, 52.7064 g. 
# Calculate the density of the metal with the correct number of significant figures.

length = 8.53 / 100
width = 2.4 / 100 
heigth = 1 / 100
mass = 52.7064
volume = length * width * heigth
density = mass / volume
